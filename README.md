# NSURLSession

I created this xcode project to learn how to download PDF files using background session.<br>

The download process works fine.<br>

I have still to find solution for the following problems:<br>

1- Progress view in custom tableview cell is not updating.<br>
2- When user start downloading files and during this download process he select other files to download the app crash with error "NSArray index beyond 0".<br>
3- When user quit the app or switch to another app, the download progress is not updating and the app crash.<br>
4- The background download sessionis not invalidated when all downloads finish.<br>

Any help is highly appreciated.<br>
